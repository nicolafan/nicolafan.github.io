## :question: Who Am I 
Hi everyone! This is Nicola Fanelli and this is my first blog post. I'm very happy to start writing this blog and to start this adventure of sharing thoughts, insights and experiences on the Internet!

In this post I just want to introduce myself.

I am a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence MSc student at the University of Bari (Italy), currently in my last university year.

I love software development and **transforming ideas into code**.

My hobbies are listening to music, reading books and watching movies and TV series. I also really like football (watching it and playing it, even if I'm just a rookie :sweat_smile:). I've always enjoyed writing, but never sticked to it too much, so I think this blog could be an awesome possibility to explore this activity and to grow with it. Writing in English will be a challenge but at the same time a very useful exercise for improving my knowledge of this beautiful language.

## :pencil: What I'll Write About on This Blog 

I've opened this blog to share thoughts and experiences about programming and AI projects, guides and insights about Computer Science and, maybe, random stuff about books, tech news and advancements in the field.

## :computer: Why Computer Science?

In this section I will just briefly explore my past and share with you the path that led me to choose to study Computer Science (and AI) 5 years ago, a choice that I'm still deeply happy about.

### :space_invader: It All Started with Videogames (Obviously)

My first time as a software user was with videogames. I've played videogames since I was 4 years old (I'm not playing much nowadays but I still really enjoy them). 

I've had the luck to enjoy the incredible evolution of videogames in the last 20 years. I've started with a PlayStation 1, and I still remember how fascinated I was when I played games on it.

This is how Spider-Man games looked like when I used to play them, in 2003:

And this is how Spider-Man Miles Morales looks like today (I made this gif personally):

I feel so awkward about this evolution. It just makes me feel so old! But it feels incredible to see how much has changed.

### :floppy_disk: My First Personal Computer (YAY!)

My first PC was not mine, it was my sister's computer. 

I think I was 5 when she got her first PC. The OS was Windows 98. We had no Internet connection, so I used to spend my time using Paint, browsing Encarta, playing Minesweeper (without knowing how to play) and watching this mind-blowing screensaver:

### :keyboard: And My First Programming Experiences
I was in highschool when I started programming. The introduction to programming was with AppInventor, then I saw some HTML, CSS and C++ (only very basic stuff) at school. 

I chose a technical institute where I studied subjects related to economics and IT. Concerning IT, at school we focused on databases and basic concepts about networks.

I didn't know yet that I wanted to study Computer Science; actually I was thinking that I would've studied something about business at the university.

After school I was called for an internship in a software house in my city, and I gave it a try. During this brief experience I've had the possibility of looking for the first time at a codebase, making small changes, connecting to servers via SSH, using Linux and reading books about programming, databases and operating systems. **I was falling in love with Computer Science and programming**, so I finally decided that I wanted to study CS!

## :hourglass_flowing_sand: A Few Years Later
After 4 years, and many exams, I have a Computer Science BSc degree and I'm an Artificial Intelligence student.

I've learned a lot during these years (and I still have a lot to learn) waiting to join the industry and working on real world problems with software and AI! :rocket:
