These are some of my projects that are not related to university or work (in chronological order on the date I started working on them).

## :skull: 10Rooms

10Rooms is a **Python arcade** in which the player must collect rubies in a haunted house without being touched by skeletons and ghosts.

This is a small project I made while reading [Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Invent-Your-Computer-Games-Python/dp/1593277954), a book I suggest to all people who want to improve their knowledge of Python and programming with computer games.

I've also drawn the sprites for this project!

## :soccer: PyLeague Soccer Simulation

PyLeague is a **software simulation of a soccer championship** developed using Python.

The goal of PyLeague is to provide the simulation of the course of one season in a realistical league (such as Lega A).

## :spades: Pyker

Pyker is a **Desktop Poker Texas Hold'Em** game made with Python and Pygame!

I've developed this game because I wanted to challenge myself with the implementation of a poker AI. Right now the game has the simplest possible AI for the bots: they just play randomly. I hope to implement different techniques in the future for making the bots "intelligent".

The implementation of the game and the interface should be finished, but I wish to refactor the code and to add tests in the future.
