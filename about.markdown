![A picture of me](/assets/images/me.png)

I am a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence MSc student at the University of Bari (Italy), currently in my last university year.

I love software development and **transforming ideas into code**.

I'm interested in **Artificial Intelligence** (especially **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**) and creating software which leverages AI to offer useful services.
